        Apollo1
      </h3>    
        Apollo1 was meant to be the first of the Apollo missions. However,<br> it did not end well. Instead, it ended in a great tragedy.
        <br>
      A few seconds before launch, a spark in the control panels caused an <br>accidential fire in the command module. The astronauts tried to open <br>the door and get out, but a problem in the door caused it to not open.<br> All three astronauts, Virgil I."Gus" Grissom, Edward H. White II, <br> and Roger B. Chaffee, were killed in the fire.
